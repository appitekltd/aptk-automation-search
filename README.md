# Automation Search
 Search across all of your Salesforce automations for keywords, including Validation Rules, Workflows, Process Builders, Triggers, and Apex Classes.

## About ##
This is a free tool we created to allow admins to quickly fine certain keywords or fields in there automation.

It is currently hosted on our [website](https://www.appitek.com/tools/automation-search/), and is free to use for anyone. You just log in to the Salesforce org you want to search, and the data is pulled in locally to your browser.

None of your data leaves the platform or is stored in local data / cookies.

## Using within Salesforce ##
If you want to use this tool directly in Salesforce rather than from our website, you can install [this unmanaged package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t4J000000rMX0).

This package contains the `AutomationSearch.vfp` Visualforce Page, the `AutomationSearchResource` Static Resource, and a custom VF Tab for the page. 

## Bugs ##
If you find any issues please let us know! We try our best to keep our free tools updated and in working order, but cannot be held responsible for any issues that occur from using them.
